                                    <li>In the restaurant industry, good service means a friendly, welcoming service. A restaurant owner should not merely strive to avoid bad service, but she should positively strive to encourage the exceptional service that occurs when service workers take a genuine interest in their customers.       
                                    For example, waiters and hosts might ask customers about their day, help them make food choices and give customers compliments. Restaurant owners can encourage this kind of good service by honoring employees who are exceptionally gifted in this area and having them train others.</li></h1>
                                    <h1 style="text-align: center">Being Available</h1>
                                    <li>Sometimes, good customer service simply means being available. Customers who can see managers, hosts and waitstaff are more likely to give employees the opportunity to provide good customer service by making requests. Many diners are hesitant to actually walk into the bar or to the counter to ask for something, and a customer should never have to shout into the kitchen. Just by being visible, you make customers feel they are having a better experience because they know if they need something, you're right there, available to help.</li>
                                    <h1 style="text-align: center">Being Exceptional</h1>
                                    <li>Customers can get good food and decent customer service almost anywhere. What will set your restaurant apart is the degree to which you are willing to go above and beyond to be exceptional. Restaurant employees can practice this kind of customer service by being willing to make special creations for guests, offering them drinks to go, bringing mints after dinner and engaging in other little practices that show they are going above and beyond the competition.</li>
                            
                                </ul>
